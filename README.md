# 🚗 Smart Claims Lakehouse

## End-to-End Databricks Data Engineering + Machine Learning Insurance Platform

---

##  Project Overview

Smart Claims Lakehouse is a production-style enterprise data platform built on Databricks that automates insurance claim processing using a unified Lakehouse architecture and AI-powered damage classification.

The system integrates structured enterprise data, real-time vehicle telemetry streams, and accident images into a single scalable environment to enable automated validation, analytics reporting, and operational decision-making.

The platform transforms a traditionally manual insurance workflow into an intelligent automated claims system.

---

##  Business Problems Solved

✔ Eliminates fragmented insurance data silos
✔ Enables near real-time accident validation
✔ Automates manual image damage inspection
✔ Detects suspicious claims for investigation
✔ Provides executive dashboards for risk monitoring

##  System Architecture (Lakehouse Pipeline)

<p align="center">
  <img src="Dashboards&End_result/Smart_claim architecture.png" width="950">
</p>

The architecture integrates multiple enterprise data sources including relational databases, streaming telemetry feeds, and object storage containing accident images.

Incoming data is processed through automated ingestion pipelines and stored in a Medallion Lakehouse:

**Landing → Bronze → Silver → Gold**

The curated datasets power dashboards, ML models, and operational applications.

---

##  Automated Claims Decision Engine

The decision workflow combines business rule validation and machine learning inference:

* Policy eligibility verification
* Coverage validation
* Telemetry speed analysis
* Accident reconstruction
* AI image severity prediction

Based on these checks, claims are automatically approved or flagged for manual investigation.

---

##  Customer Claim Submission Portal

Customers upload accident images, policy details, and incident information through this operational interface.
The portal connects directly with backend pipelines and deployed ML services for real-time claim analysis.

---

##  Automated Claim Processing Output

After evaluating image severity, policy coverage, telematics data, and financial checks, the system automatically generates claim decisions. Approved claims proceed automatically while suspicious cases are routed for investigation.

---

## Insurance Analytics Dashboard

The dashboard presents operational and financial insights such as:

* Loss ratio metrics
* Liability exposure
* Incident distribution by severity
* Insurance performance tracking

These dashboards support executive-level monitoring and decision-making.

---

##  Incident Trend & Severity Analytics

Aggregated visualizations reveal temporal incident patterns, severity distribution, and financial impact trends across accident categories.

This enables proactive risk assessment and operational planning.
